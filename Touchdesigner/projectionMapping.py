Projection mapping
(matching images to an obect by projection)
To see the different ways to map in TD,
go to the Dialogs menu and select Palette Browser.
In the Palette Browser, select mapping.
The 3 most used are 
camSchnapper - for using with a 3d model of your projection surface, 
Kantan - for quick 2d mapping, and 
stoner - for grid warping (can be used with the other 2, as a final adjustment).
Drag the one you want to use (or investigate) into
your project.
